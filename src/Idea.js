/*
 * Idea.js is a library, meant for creating rich presentations that primarily
 * contain interactive animations and pictures right in the browser window.
 * 
 * Idea.js also comes with an in-browser GUI viewer/editor, where you can 
 * create or view your presentations.
 * 
 * Your GUI editor may be in one of 2 modes: edit or view. In edit mode you
 * are supplied with a canvas to draw your presentation on and with tools to 
 * aid you. You can drag presentation elements around the canvas. 
 * You'll use view mode to display your presentation to users. If your audience 
 * is viewing your presentation in a browser, they can also interact with 
 * presentation, but only in the manner, that you specified.
 * 
 * Presentaton window is split into 4 parts.
 *   - The leftmost part is slidebar. Presentation consists of slides.
 *   - The lower part is timeline. Each slide contains its own timeline, 
 *     independent of other slides.
 *   - The central part is Canvas. This is where your slides are shown, here
 *     you create your presentation elements and this is what your audience 
 *     wants to see in view mode.
 *   - The right-central part is a tabbed Tools panel. In edit mode it contains
 *     Layers bar, Widgets selection bar, Widget options panel, Transitions 
 *     selection bar, Transition options panel, Source code bar, Properties
 *     bar and Comments bar.
 *     In view mode it contains only Properties bar and Comments bar.
 *
 * Presentation elements are called Widgets. In edit mode you can add new 
 * widgets to the Canvas, choosing them from Widgets selection bar. You can 
 * customize widget, by clicking on it and using Widget options panel that 
 * appears in the Tools panel. You can also directly set its properties in
 * javascript code in Source code bar.
 * 
 * Widgets may contain daughterly widgets.
 *
 * Each widget corresponds to a Group in the Layers bar. Group may
 * contain daughterly Layers and Groups. Layer is a logical object, which
 * corresponds to the widget itself, while its daughterly widgets
 * are represented by their own Groups within current widget's Group.
 *
 * Note that you CAN'T write absolutely arbitrary javascript code in Source 
 * code bar for security reasons - otherwise, black hat hackers would've been
 * able to introduce malicious code otherwise. All the code, entered in Source
 * code bar is sanitized via white-list-based sanitizer.
 *
 * Idea.js makes use of getterSetters (possibly overloaded, i.e. in multiple forms)
 * to access and modify attributes of objects. E.g. you can say widget.opacity()
 * to obtain opacity value of your widget and say widget.opacity(0.5) to set
 * its opacity to 50%. So the same method "opacity" acts both as getter and setter.
